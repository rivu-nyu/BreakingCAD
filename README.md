# PaperCAD Edge: Intelligent Sketch-to-CAD Converter

PaperCAD Edge is a powerful, local-first application that transforms both **hand-drawn sketches** and **professional floor plans** into clean, editable, and intelligent CAD models. By leveraging NPU acceleration, PaperCAD Edge delivers real-time performance, making it ideal for on-the-go design and digitization.

## üöÄ Key Use Cases

  * **Real-Time Conversion**: Use your device's camera to capture a live image of a sketch and watch it instantly become a clean CAD model on your screen.
  * **Hand-Drawn Sketch Digitization**: Transform rough, back-of-the-napkin sketches into geometrically perfect and editable DXF files. Our "**Geometric Intelligence**" engine cleans up imperfections and understands your design intent.
  * **Professional Floor Plan Processing**: Upload existing high-quality floor plans or scanned drawings to quickly convert them into layered, parametric CAD models.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Multi-Input Support**: Processes PNGs, JPEGs, and live camera feeds.
  * **Geometric Intelligence**: Goes beyond simple tracing to infer constraints like perpendicularity and parallelism, cleaning up rough drawings.
  * **AI-Powered Line & Symbol Detection**: Uses a pipeline of advanced models to accurately identify walls, doors, windows, and other symbols.
  * **Text & Dimension Recognition**: Automatically reads text labels from drawings using **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition), preparing the geometry for clean, scaled export.
  * **3D Generation**: Instantly extrudes 2D floor plans into 3D wall prisms with proper thickness and height.
  * **NPU Acceleration**: Seamlessly utilizes the NPU for core AI tasks to ensure real-time performance and energy efficiency.

## üß† Our AI Pipeline

Our system uses a combination of specialized, lightweight models for maximum accuracy and speed.

  * **Structure Detection**: A lightweight CNN + Transformer architecture (like M-LSD) turns the image into clean line segments.
  * **Symbol Detection**: A quantized YOLOv8-Nano model identifies specific symbols like doors and windows.
  * **Text Recognition**: We use PaddleOCR for its high accuracy and efficiency in reading dimensions and labels.
  * **Geometric Refinement**: A Graph Neural Network (GNN) analyzes the relationships between detected lines to refine alignment and snap junctions, ensuring a geometrically perfect output.

```

### Python API

```python
from local_png_to_dxf import process_png_to_dxf

# Convert PNG to DXF
output_path = process_png_to_dxf(
    "input_floorplan.png",
    output_path="output.dxf",
    show_preview=True
)
```
